            <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
            <p>The pizza arrives still steaming from our Stefano Ferrara wood burning oven<br>. The crust is thin, with
                a
                blistered cornicione—the raised <br>rim of the pizza that’s the outer crust of the pizza — about an inch
                thick. <br>It is neither thin and crispy nor thick and soft but chewy and crisp all at once.<br> Because
                it
                is handcrafted, no two are exactly alike. <br>The toppings are fresh and natural with each ingredient
                tasting very much like what it is.<br> Our pizza strikes a careful balance among crust, sauce,<br> and
                cheese with not too much of any one component. </p>
